# UDP server with Hosted mode support

This code example demonstrates the implementation of a UDP server with CYW955913EVK-01 on CM33 and also enables Hosted mode support. Details on how to excercise the hosted mode features are explained in the [AN240670](https://www.infineon.com/an240670)

The below contents explains how to excercise the CM33 application.

In this example, the UDP server establishes a connection with a UDP client. After the successful connection, the server allows the user to send LED ON/OFF command to the UDP client and the client responds by sending an acknowledgement message to the server. This CE also enables the Hosted mode support. 

## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade; software](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) v3.2 or later (tested with v3.2)
- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version for : v1.0.0.
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: CYW955913EVK-01


## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; embedded compiler v11.3.1 (`GCC_ARM`) - Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`


## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')
- [CYW955913EVK-01 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; Prototyping Kit](https://www.infineon.com/CYW955913EVK-01) (`CYW955913EVK-01`)



## Hardware setup

This example uses the kitâ€™s default configuration. See the respective kit guide to ensure that the kit is configured correctly.

## Software setup

1. Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

2. Install a Python interpreter if you don't have one. This code example is tested using [Python 3.7.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/).


## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br />

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-wifi-udp-server](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-wifi-udp-server-hm)" application with the desired name "UdpServer" configured for the *CYW955913EVK-01* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CYW955913EVK-01 --app-id mtb-example-wifi-udp-server --user-app-name UdpServer --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br />

Following example adds the CYW955913EVK-01 BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/UdpServer" --add-bsp-name CYW955913EVK-01 --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/UdpServer" --set-active-bsp APP_CYW955913EVK-01
   ```

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Modify the `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, and `WIFI_SECURITY_TYPE` macros to match the credentials of the Wi-Fi network that you want to connect. These macros are defined in the *udp_server.h* file. Ensure that the Wi-Fi network that you are connecting to is configured as a private network for the proper functioning of this example.

3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port/Serial port. Set the port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program **.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=APP_<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=APP_CYW955913EVK-01 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

5. After programming, reser the board to start the application. Confirm that the following text as shown in **Figure 1** is displayed on the UART terminal. Note that Wi-Fi SSID and the IP address assigned will be different based on the network that you have connected to.

     **Figure 1. UART terminal showing the Wi-Fi connectivity status**

     ![](images/uart-terminal-output.png)


6. Ensure that your computer is connected to the same Wi-Fi access point that you have configured in **Step 2**. Make a note of the IP address assigned to the kit as shown in **Figure 1**.

7. Update the IP address from **Figure 1** in *udp_client.py* and then Open a command shell from the project directory to run the Python UDP client (*udp_client.py*).

   ```
   python udp_client.py 
   ```

   **Note:** Ensure that the firewall settings of your computer allow access to the Python software so that it can communicate with the UDP server. For more details on enabling Python access, see this [community thread](https://community.infineon.com/t5/ModusToolbox-General/CE229112-Enable-Python-access-to-your-WiFi/td-p/214654).

8. Press the user button (**CYBSP_USER_BTN**) to send the LED ON/OFF command to the Python UDP client. Each user button press will issue the LED ON or LED OFF commands alternately. The client in turn sends an acknowledgement message back to the server. **Figure 2** and **Figure 3** show the UDP server and UDP client outputs respectively.

   **Figure 2. UDP server output**

   ![](images/udp-server-output.png)

   <br />

   **Figure 3. UDP client output**

   ![](images/udp-client-output.png)

   **Note:** Instead of using the Python UDP client (*udp_client.py*), you can use the [mtb-example-threadx-wifi-udp-client](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-threadx-wifi-udp-client-hm) example to run as UDP client on the second kit. See the code example documentation to learn how to use the example.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Attach (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).
